Since the developers of Waterdog apparently didn't come up with the idea of putting something like this into the software, I thought to myself: Why not do it myself? I'll do it for you, the community!

Command:

- /waterdogplugins [pluginname] or /wdpl [pluginname]

Permission:

- waterdog.command.plugins

Have fun with it! ✌️
